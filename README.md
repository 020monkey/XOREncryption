XOR Encryption
==================

Simple implementation of XOR Encryption/Decrypting in various languages, including:

- [C](C/main.c)
- [C++](C++/main.cpp)
- [Groovy](Groovy/XOREncryption.groovy)
- [Java](Java (Android compatible\)/XOREncryption.java) 
- [JavaScript](JavaScript/XOREncryption.js)
- [Objective-C](Objective-C/main.m)
- [Python](Python/XOREncryption.py)

This implementation goes beyond the basic single-key model to use multiple keys in a particular sequence, making it that much more difficult to brute-force.

In these examples, I'm encrypting the same string with the same keys in order to keep consistency with the output, and to demonstrate that an encrypted string from a C program will be decryptable in a Java application, etc.
